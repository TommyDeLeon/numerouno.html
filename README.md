# ☕ Project Documentation: Crafting a Cafe Menu with CSS 🍮

Welcome to Part 2 of our journey! This project is affectionately named **numerouno.html** after my friend's coffee shop, "Numero Uno." I'm brewing up plans to enhance this work into a full-fledged website as a gift for them. Exciting, isn't it? 😊

## 🛠️ Technology Used
This project is a delightful blend of **HTML** and **CSS**. HTML is our foundation, structuring the content of the webpage, while CSS is our artist, styling the webpage to perfection.

## 🎓 Lessons Learned
This project was a deep dive into the world of semantic HTML elements and CSS styling. We learned how to:
- Structure a webpage using elements like main, section, article, header, and footer 📚
- Use CSS to style these elements, including setting the font family and size, text alignment, margins, and colors 🎨

## 🎨 What Was Created
We brewed a simple cafe menu webpage. The webpage displays a tantalizing list of coffee and dessert items, each with a name and price. The webpage also includes a header with the cafe name and establishment year, and a footer with a link to the cafe's website and its address.

## 💡 Ideas to Make It Better
### Add more interactivity:
Our webpage is currently static. Adding some JavaScript could make it more interactive. Imagine being able to add items to a cart and calculate the total price! 🛒
### Improve accessibility: 
Let's ensure our webpage is accessible to all users. This could include adding more descriptive alt text for images, ensuring sufficient color contrast, and adding ARIA attributes where necessary. 🌐
### Responsive design: 
Let's make the webpage responsive so that it looks good on all screen sizes. This could involve using media queries to adjust the layout and font sizes on smaller screens. 📱

## 📸 Visuals
Here are some screenshots of our delightful cafe menu webpage:
