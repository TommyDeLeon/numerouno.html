Part 2 - Building a Cafe Menu with CSS
I named this as "numerouno.html" because I have a friend that has a coffee shop named "Numero Uno." I am planning on improving this work into a website, and give it to them. :)

## Technology Used
This project uses HTML and CSS. HTML is used to structure the content of the webpage, and CSS is used to style the webpage.

## Lessons Learned
This project demonstrates how to structure a webpage using semantic HTML elements like main, section, article, header, and footer. It also shows how to use CSS to style these elements, including setting the font family and size, text alignment, margins, and colors.

## What Was Created
A simple cafe menu webpage was created. The webpage displays a list of coffee and dessert items, each with a name and price. The webpage also includes a header with the cafe name and establishment year, and a footer with a link to the cafe's website and its address.

## Ideas to Make It Better
### Add more interactivity:
Currently, the webpage is static. Adding some JavaScript could make it more interactive. For example, you could add a feature for users to add items to a cart and calculate the total price.
### Improve accessibility: 
Ensure that the webpage is accessible to all users. This could include adding more descriptive alt text for images, ensuring sufficient color contrast, and adding ARIA attributes where necessary.
### Responsive design: 
Make the webpage responsive so that it looks good on all screen sizes. This could involve using media queries to adjust the layout and font sizes on smaller screens.
